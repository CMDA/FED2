/**
 * Closure:

 * ECMAScript allows inner functions. 
 * Inner functions are allowed access to all of the local variables, parameters and declared inner functions 
 * of its outer function(s). A closure is formed when one of those inner functions is made accessible outside 
 * of the function in which it was contained, so that it may be executed after the outer function has returned. 
 * At which point it still has access to the local variables, parameters and inner function declarations of 
 * its outer function.
